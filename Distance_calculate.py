# Sensor type: OmniVision OV5647[6] Color CMOS QSXGA (5-megapixel)
# Sensor size: 3.67 x 2.74 mm (1/4" format)
# Pixel Count: 2592 x 1944
# Pixel Size: 1.4 x 1.4 um
# Lens: f=3.6 mm, f/2.9
# Angle of View: 54 x 41 degrees
# Field of View: 2.0 x 1.33 m at 2 m
# Full-frame SLR lens equivalent: 35 mm
# Fixed Focus: 1 m to infinity
# Video: 1080p at 30 fps with codec H.264 (AVC)
# Up to 90 fps Video at VGA
# Board size: 25 x 24 mm (not including flex cable)
# Test Fixture Holes: 4x D=2.15 mm on 12.5 x 21.0 mm centers
# Because the focal length of the lens is roughly the same as the width of the sensor, it is easy to remember the field of view: at x meters away, you can see about x meters horizontally, assuming 4x3 stills mode. Horizontal field of view in 1080p video mode is 75% of that (75% H x 55% V sensor crop for 1:1 pixels at 1920x1080).
